# Obligatory Social Card app

## What
Filing this under "What I should build while I'm waiting for inspiration for something to build". Would that be under W, I, or B?

Playing with a dummy-user API to build and style social cards. 

## Why
Lern stuph. 

While I think about more interesting things to build, I do not want to not play with React. This is the React version of bobbling a ball on the sidelines while waiting to be called in: work on skills, stay warmed up, look cute for your crush who might show up. 

## Toolbox
